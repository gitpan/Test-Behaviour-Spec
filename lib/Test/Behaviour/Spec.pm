=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Behaviour::Spec;
    use Test::More tests => 5;
    
    BEGIN { use_ok('Counter') }
    
    {
        describe 'Counter';
        
        it 'should create an instance.';
            ok ref(Counter->new), spec;
    }
    
    {
        describe '$counter, when counting up,'
            my $counter = Counter->new;
        
        it 'should has a initial value zero.';
            is $counter->value, 0, spec;
            my $v = $counter->value;
        
        it 'should count up.';
            ok $counter->can('up'), spec;
            $counter->up;
        
        it 'should return a succeed value from the initial one.';
            is $counter->value, $v + 1, spec;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Let's play believe that we are the Behaviour Driven Developers,
putting some additional interiors in our tests. This module
provides you such interiors of three subroutines: 'describe', 'it',
and 'spec'. The naming of them are based on the RSpec that is
a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for the ruby 
programing language.

=head1 SUBROUTINES 

=over

=item C<describe "SUBJECT, when SITUATON,">

The subroutine 'describe' calls a name of a subject with a situation.

=item C<it "should behave ...">

The subroutine 'it' becomes a subject in the behaviour statement.

=item C<spec>

The subroutine 'spec' builds a test name as a statement string
with a subject at last C<describe> subroutine and a statement
at the last C<it> subroutine.

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Test::More::Behaviours> is gives you behaviours in a code reference.
    
L<http://rspec.info/> is the original Behaviour Driven Development
framework for Ruby.
